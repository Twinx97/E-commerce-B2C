# Ecommerce (Business to consumer)

# Project GOAL:
To gain experience and to create an example website for future potential customers.

# Development Notes for myself
When a client buys a website, they don't always know what the need/want.
Think about why the business wants a website, what are they gonna use it for. Find the purpose for them having a website. How do I turn their needs into code?


## Development progress
I check what is needed for the project in TODO, then I check Bootstrap for the right containers etc.
